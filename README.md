Submitted by: Kaushik Hariharan

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

I mainly used the tutorials provided as well as other pages online, such as tutorialspoint and geeks for geeks.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

Some of the styled components of buttons was challenging to get and to replicate exactly how I wanted it to look like. For example, the proper padding for the buttons to match each and every button was something that was a trial and error process. Another aspect was when finding out the pitches of the different buttons. I wanted the buttons to sort of emulate the C Major Scale in Music Theory. Thus, finding the correct frequency took some time. The logic for the different guesses and debugging the code for start and stop was also somewhat of a challenge that I was able to overcome.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Although this was a simple and small scale game that I made, I'm wondering how the hollistic web development process looks like at a corporate level. For example, in this game, I only have a some javascript, along with some html and css for the style. But I'm interested in seeing how a corporation approaches web development and the other technologies that they use synonymously. I'm also wondering the testing and integrated testing that is done, and whether it's is done on each file or feature, or if it's done after each block of "code" or "software" has been developed.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

This game was very fun to make and I'm very happy that I was able to replicate a predominate popular music major scale into the buttons. However, if I did have more time to work on this project, I would definitely add some animations (or emojis) on the side, mainly to denote if the player's guess is right or wrong (or if they have lost). I would've also added a timer to finish the entire game within a minute or two. As an advanced implementation, I would also add different levels that get progressively harder and faster each time they "level up". But with the time that was given and the problem statement that assigned, I thoroughly enjoyed this process and had a lot of fun making this application.
